**Exploring R packages**

- Package title: dplyr
- Location: CRAN
- Vignette(s): dplyr has a formal vignette that covers backends, functions, and installation. It also gives brief examples of how to use filter(), select(), mutate(), summarise(), and arrange(). 
- Application(s): There is a website that covers most of what the CRAN vignette does but in a more readable fashion. Link: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/
- Review: The primary purpose of dplyr is to help with data manipulation and cleaning. I like this package because it is easy to get the hang of and houses powerful functions. Before really learning how to use R, I was using the dpylr package to parse through a dataset. For a beginner, it was very straightforward. I don’t like using mutate() often because it doesn’t feel very intuitive to me, and I only use it when I have to. I prefer creating new variables with base R. There are rarely times when I don’t use dplyr. I would highly recommend this package to anyone.
